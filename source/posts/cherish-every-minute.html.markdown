# Cherish Every Damn Minute
![photo of the mess](/posts/cherish-every-minute/themess.jpg)

About once a week (sometimes more often) someone stops me and says, almost condescendingly, “make sure you’re cherishing every moment with Clementine.”  I half-smile wearily and nod in acknowledgement thinking to myself “I would sure cherish a shower right now” – it’s not that I’m ungrateful for the abundance in my life, or that I don’t adore Clementine. I think that fact is obvious to anyone who follows my instagram account.  

But, I’m in the trenches here all day every day and all night every night. I’m busily spending every minute (actively, or mentally) nurturing this human and providing a healthy environment for her to grow.  I’m learning how to be sensitive to her unique needs, and working hard to be understanding and compassionate of her frustrations.  I’m pouring myself into this daily effort…and I am regularly chastised that I should be enjoying more, and differently.   It feels condemning.   It feels damning.

It’s like I’m doing hard manual labor to plow a field and prepare a crop, and someone is yelling at me that I’d better be having the time of my life because I am going to miss that plowing when it’s done.  It’s not that I don’t see the value in the plowing.  It’s not that I can’t appreciate the fresh air, the exercise, the warm sun on my face, the deep ache in my bones at the end of every day that validates my efforts.  I see the value in those things, and often I do enjoy it.  But let’s be honest: sometimes I wish it wasn’t what I had to be doing right now.  Sometimes, I would like a break.  Sometimes, I do it only because it’s a labor of love and I know the outcome will be worth it.  

I’m probably not going to really treasure that plowing time as a precious commodity until I’m enjoying the fruit of my labor.  That’s not a bad thing. That’s the cycle of life.  As time passes, the weariness fades, the angst fades, and we’re able to reap and remember the highlights.  

This concept doesn’t apply only to parenting, it applies to every season of life.  I remember people giving me similar advice as a teenager, and sometimes I think of it in the context of my relationship with Nathaniel.  There are memories with him that I really genuinely cherish from my teenage years.  At face value, they’re silly things: 3AM emails, or conversations about Narnia, monkeys, and taking over the world.  It’s that one time that he “had” to hang around my house until my chili was done cooking and ready to eat.  Or the memory of the first time we watched Napoleon Dynamite together and Nathaniel was so embarrassed about Uncle Rico’s “bust must” flyers that he shoved his head down between the cushions of my couch for a good 3 or 4 minutes.  Were those things I cherished at the time?  Not really.  Not actively.  

You know what I *was* doing actively?  I was participating in life.  I was making connections, and making an effort.  I was showing up.  Despite the fact that I was depressed.  Despite the fact that my world had been turned upside down and at 15 I was newly sharing my bedroom with a 7 and 4 year old.  I kept taking one step, I kept plowing, and nurturing life, and relationships…and 10 years later, it paid off.  10 years later, it’s something I cherish. 

So, don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge advocate of mindfulness, and deliberate gratefulness as a practice through our every day life flow.  

But, indulge me in posing a few questions…

…what if we stopped chastising people to cherish their life right now – and instead, we encourage them in their efforts to participate in their life right now?  “Burnout” is a phrase that I hear and use far too often. It's often followed by shutdown, survival mode.  
…what if we were compassionate to their effort, rather than condemning?  
…what if we show up for life with them rather than interjecting from the outside?  
…what if we empathize with their needs, even if we don’t understand them?  
…what if we found ways to be helpful and encouraging without being critical?

Host a coffee date, just listen, shoot a funny meme in a text message, be willing to say something embarrassing with hopes of getting a laugh or making a connection, go for a walk together, have hard conversations, have real conversations, learn to acknowledge and honor when someone needs time alone, or watch trashy TV and drink a little too much wine together.

What if we participated in relationships in a way that gives those around us the opportunity to be restored and filled up as they move through their own lives?  What if that means stepping out of ourselves?

Let’s change our perspective on cherishing.  Cherishing is something that you do retroactively, not actively.  Instead, let’s encourage each other to fill up our lives now so that we will have things to cherish later, rather than contributing to each other’s weariness and feelings of inadequacy.   

I work hard to fill up my life, and I’m glad you’re here to join me. I hope that my blog will encourage you, I  hope it will empower you with tools and thought provoking conversations. I hope sometimes I can provide funny anecdotes that make you think “well at least I’m not as crazy as Lindsey.”   I hope that sometimes, once in a while, something I say will come along side you wherever you are right now and give you an idea to help fill up your cup a little bit more, so that in your next season you can reflect back and cherish this one.  

Let’s fill life together…with movement, conversation, camaraderie, and community…with risks, failed efforts, self-care, alone time, quiet, dance parties, toddler-belly-kisses, odd contrasts, good wholesome food, delicious cocktails, grand schemes, simple pleasures, and floor pillows.

Let’s stop condemning each other, and start being a community.
