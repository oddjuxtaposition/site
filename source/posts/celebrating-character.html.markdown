# Celebrating Character, and Combatting the Culture of Comparison
*Why I don’t post developmental milestones on Facebook.*

If you were to ask me “how old is Clementine” my answer for the past several weeks and for the next nine or ten months will be “a year.”   I know, I’m in the minority.   Parents love to say “fifty-seven weeks” or “fourteen-and-a-half months.”  Recently, I even heard someone say that their child was “forty-three months” old. I stood there, baffled, trying to calculate in my head on 3 hours sleep and half a cappuccino how many twelves fit into forty-three.

Now, this isn’t the first topic that I’m outside-the-norm on, it certainly won’t be the last.  But this is one that has gotten under my skin a lot lately.  Probably just due to season of life. 

I’ll admit that part of it must be my own surly, socially awkward oblivion.  I simply don’t understand why it matters to complete strangers how old my child is down to the weeks? I don’t understand why extended family members care how much my child weighs now?  Like, are you going to go stack up twenty-three butter boxes so you can pretend you’re holding her from across the country?  

So, there’s that.  I don’t “get it” and I fully admit that part of it is just me.  What can I say? I’m a scrooge to tradition.  It seems like a meaningless way to prolong conversation, feels hollow.  Smalltalk and convention obviously aren’t my forté and most of the time it makes me really sad for the people asking, because I feel like they miss so much of who Clementine is.   They see her as “generic baby” and miss out on her wild personality, the fact that she loves building, bugs, adventure, dancing, and the outdoors. They don’t get past generic descriptors like “she’s so sweet” to really see that she’s stubborn, and clever, remarkably opinionated, but also kind, and has amazing self-restraint to be gentle (when she’s reminded) even though her nature is to be rough-and-tumble.  

I guess this is a good segue back to my main point:  why make the distinction of months, or weeks, except with the end goal of comparing to someone else?   And let’s be honest, that’s usually how the conversation goes. 

“So-and-so is getting so big! How old is she now?”  
“She is! Almost a year.”  
“Right, but how many months?”  
“Oh, I don’t know, ten I guess.  Yeah, ten, last week.”  
“Has she reached X milestone yet?” 

Then you answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and they proceed to tell you about their child/grandchild/niece/neighbor who reached X milestone at 8 months!  And once again, maybe it’s my own social dysfunction, but frankly I don’t care.  I’m not saying this out of shame or embarrassment.  I’m not saying it because Clementine is painfully behind on some Doctor Google developmental milestone chart.  She’s been ahead on some things, she’s been dead-on with others, and some she’s lagged behind with.   

I’m saying this because all I can see in these conversations, is a culture of comparison that really could only feasibly exist in (relatively) recent history.  

Before social media, and phones, and “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” — your great-uncle’s brother’s best friend wouldn’t know that your child had six teeth now, or was rolling from back to tummy.   The people that *would* know are your inner circle, the people that you converse with regularly, the people you do life with in a recipricol relationship or community.

Now, don’t mistake my dismissal of the **comparison culture** as my *not caring* that Clementine is growing and developing.  It is a joy to watch her learn new life skills.  It’s a joy to see her discovering her own abilities, and feeling safe and confident in how capable she is.  I’m very proud and it’s something I truly adore sharing with Nathaniel.  I love the time in the day when he gets home from work and she stomps across the floor and squeezes her hands open and shut wanting him to pick her up, and I love sharing all the new things I was privileged to watch her discover today.  

But because of this culture we’ve created, it’s not something you can share publically without it becoming an immediate comparison game.  This is part of the reason I’m hesitant to post developmental milestones on Facebook, I don't want to feel shamed as a parent, and I don't want to participate in a one-upmanship.  Most babies will grasp objects, grow teeth, learn to walk, become verbal, etc. eventually.  So what if it happens 2 months earlier or later than some other baby you happen to know? Really.  It won’t matter 10 years from now.  And, I say “most” because I acknowledge that there are also families that are struggling, families that are celebrating their 4-year-olds finally becoming verbal and they deserve to be able to celebrate too.


It’s not about political correctness.  It’s about compassion, it’s about acknowledging the toxicity of our lives being entirely permeated by social media, and actively working to keep it in check.  For me, personally, it’s about celebrating my child and my friends children for their own uniqueness of character.  

I will note, here, that I was chatting about this very topic with a friend recently and she said “That’s unfair, though. There shouldn’t be any pressure or expectations about milestones, but everyone should be able to share and celebrate them whenever they happen for a child.” And yes, she’s right, they *should* be able to…and I try to participate in that celebration when people I know post things or share milestones that are exciting for their family.

I don’t share them personally because I feel like it would be hypocritical of me, and would be diminishing and generalizing my child and my friends or relatives children into charts.   So, instead, I post things that are uniquely Clementine.  I also try to ask mindful questions, and make genuine conversation when I’m talking to other parents. And you know what? I've met some really cool kids by actually noticing THEM.  

I also actively work to cultivate relationships with an “inner circle” of people (some family, a few friends) who do **know** Clementine and can celebrate all of the milestones with the bigger context of **who she is.**

Historically speaking it wouldn’t have been possible to share every little milestone with every person in all of your extended circles, and maybe that was a good thing?  Maybe developmental milestones exist to teach us something as parents, to give us insight into how life works and a new perspective on what it’s like to discover the world for the first time.  

For me? I definitely see a lot of grace, trust, faith, and perseverance that I admire in Clementine as she grows and develops; grace, trust, faith, and perseverance that I could only hope to someday mirror in my own life.  

Maybe there is a deeper value in these precious moments that we’re losing out on by sharing them with everyone, versus sharing with our significant other, or close friends, or whoever we’re doing life with.  

What if our children have something uniquely “them” to share with the world from the time they’re born, part of their purpose, and we’re so hung up on whether they’re sitting up yet that we don’t notice their personality, preferences, or character growth.

Please don’t read a tone of condemnation into my words.  That’s not my intent at all, I’m not here to condemn or chastise anyone.  Only to explain my own reasoning and pose a few considerations that I’ve been mulling over.   Most of them I don’t have answers to.  I do what fits for our family, and celebrate others doing what fits for theirs. 

It’s just a topic I’m mindful of.  

And, a further consideration, even though it does dwindle as we get older it doesn’t ever go away.  I still feel the effects of this culture of comparison from when I was a child and adolescent.  Not from my own parents, but from other adults in my life.  Parents who would compare me to their child, openly, verbally, in front of me.  I know for a fact that other people I grew up around felt that pressure and comparison also. 

And, in some aspects, I say “tough shit, it’s part of life.”  There will be comparison, competition, hurt feelings.  And that can be a catalyst to build character, also.  

But I would rather celebrate Clementine’s accomplishments, her character, the things she works for and earns, and the things that are uniquely her, than to make her self conscious that her body develops or functions differently than someone else her age. 

In addition to giving other parents a little boost of confidence, if we take a little extra time to observe and look past what we think we should be seeing, we might find a place beyond *“generic gaggle of toddlers”* to discover this amazing world of tiny humans that are full of insight, and energy, and miniature parable-type versions of big, important, humbling life lessons.
