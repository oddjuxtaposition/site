*My never-ending quest for culinary consciousness*

![eat all the things](/posts/eatallthethings/eatallthethings.jpg)

If you've followed my health journey or even my personal life a little over the past few years you've probably heard me say "Paleo", "THM" and "Foodie" in a sentence or two. If you've known me for 10 minutes you've probably heard me say "wine", "beer" and "tacos" 5 times each.

Yet another facet of my life in which I am an odd juxtaposition: food. 

The topic of food for me is closely tied with my wellness and fitness journey, but for the purpose of this post I'm going to spare you the personal narrative on chronic lyme disease, essential oils, GAPS diet, paleo, and Restorative Exercise because I have recently recognized my tendency to provide more information than the conversation at hand really needs. What can I say? I like details. 

While discussing healthy food choices with a friend over coffee recently, she said “I’ve tried X diet, and Y eating plan.  I was vegan, but I recently started adding meat back into my diet” she shrugged,  “I’m a searcher.”  

Nodding solemnly, I thought “yep. That’s me.”

I’ve spent the past 6 or 7 years trying a variety of different ways to pursue health. Looking back now, my first thought is “I started so far on the wrong track” — but you know, for the information I had at the time, that isn’t entirely true.  I never tried diet pills or MLM weight loss products.  I knew my strategy was to feel better, be stronger, have more confidence…the weight would work itself out. 

One of the spots I’ve often goten hung up on is that I love food in the most obnoxiously pretentious way.  I could turn down a Chick Fil A sandwich any day of the week (what’s the deal with Chick Fil A anyway??), but if you offer me foie gras, homemade freshly baked focaccia bread, or a plate of authentic, high-quality, nigiri sushi…well, I get weak.  

The further complication of me adhering to any strict lifelong food change is that I love to cook.   I love to create beautiful, complex, meticulous, diverse foods. I love the flavors of french peasant foods, the way delicate jasmine rice balances a spicy, creamy curry.  One of my life goals is to have a leather knife roll with my initials embossed into it and a collection of vintage knives.  I even applied for culinary school shortly before I found out I was expecting Clementine. 

The reality is…when I confront it honestly, I can’t help but feel like I keep taking this fundamentally simple thing and perpetuating it into one of the most complicated components of my life.  

I do recognize that we have to be conscious of the fact that as a culture, in the US especially, we’ve taken 
simple and healthful ingredients and mutated them into things that our bodies can’t even recognize as food.  The meat stocked in most grocery stores comes from animals treated inhumanely and living in grotesque conditions, and the grains we eat are so processed that our bodies treat them like we’re eating spoonfuls of white sugar (not in a romantic, Mary Poppins way). 

But does it have to be so complicated that we can’t enjoy it, and do we really need to spend every waking moment scraping green gunk out of our blenders, washing dishes, and trying to remember what we have to exclude from our meal plan this week?

This premise was what initially drew me to the “Trim Healthy Mama” eating plan.  My Mom was persistent in encouraging me to read about it and the premise seemed sound.  The history and science made sense: the idea is historically, due to availability and daily rhythms of living a more traditional lifestyle without modern amenities humans would have naturally separated their fuels (fat and carbs) into separate meals.  So the idea seems simple: eat a meal or snack every 3 hours, center it around protein and choose to add either fat, or carbs, just not both.  There’s quite a few more guidelines than that, but that’s the basics in two sentences. 

They tout “food freedom” and the THM groupies talk a lot about losing weight while eating chocolate cake every day.  It sounded good and I followed it pretty well while I was pregnant and maintained a healthy weight, a slow gain only gained 20 lbs overall (I was overweight to begin with), and Clementine was born healthy and has the immune system of a horse. 

I fell off the THM wagon as a brand new Mom with a newborn.  I found THM to be very time intensive and not something I could figure out a way to master and maintain with my lack of sleep and very intense, determined baby.  

When Clementine hit around 9 months old I went to a new, integrative, holistic doctor who posed a theory that my thyroid was malfunctioning as a side effect of the lyme disease I’d been battling for several years. I had gained quite a bit of weight, despite really eating quite healthfully—not THM—but, we ARE sugar-free, we eat minimal raw/low-temp-pasteurized dairy, and only eat grains or legumes once or twice a week (sprouted, soured, or soaked).   We eat moderately, and use high-quality ingredients.  My doctor wasn’t convinced that my weight or health was something that could be “healed” by foods and supplements alone.  

But I’m stubborn and decided to try healing my body with food before I resigned to medical intervention.  A few weeks of research led me back to THM, and I decided to give it a shot again.   I was very gung-ho for about six weeks.  I didn’t have to detox from white sugar, sodas, and pasta cravings, so it was more of a shift and a few minor tweaks and optimizations of our existing eating habits.  I shifted how we ate, incorporated some new recipes, and really gave it a solid try.  The first two weeks I gained weight.  “That’s normal” I told myself “my body is adjusting, it’ll drop though,” and I was sorta right…about 4 weeks it it seemed that I had dropped 5-7 lbs. but, I was miserable.  I wanted to cry every morning I woke up and had to think through what to eat, and how to prepare it, and how to make something different or extra for my husband.  My usual hill of dishes had become an uncontrollable mountain, I was drowning in dishes and food prep.  I was ALWAYS hungry.  I read through the THM forums and admin suggestions for troubleshooting these issues, and decided to adjust and soldier forth.  Another 2 weeks later, I had gained back the weight that I’d lost the two weeks previously, I felt awful, fatigued, hungry, and stressed with dishes and food preparation.  I was also sick of eating “sweets” — I know that sounds weird, and it’s not that the THM desserts and shakes aren’t delicious, they are, but I felt like if I had to look at another german chocolate protein shake, or giant jar of sweetened “sippers” I was going to give up eating for good. It’s not really a necessary human condition, right? That’s a myth.

So I decided to back off, and reexamine. 

Why wasn’t THM working for me?  

Aside from the sheer amount of work it was to plan, prepare, implement, and clean up from executing this eating plan day in and day out, the two things that didn’t “click” for me were:

First, that I didn’t feel like I had any freedom to be creative with my cooking anymore  I felt very boxed in to “copycat” recipes of american staples that I don’t even like (hamburger helper, tuna casserole, etc.) and wasn’t enjoying something that I really enjoyed doing for my family and friends in previous seasons of life. Something that is really a passion of mine. 

Second, that the THM community is so focused on weight loss.  I’ve worked SO hard to combat that world view and work on focusing on how I feel as a gauge of my health, and I really would rather focus on living a healthful, mindful life, that is flowing well in all areas, and being free of pain, than achieving a certain number on the scale.  

I do think it’s a great program, I admire and respect the writers, and I think they’re doing wonderful things towards helping people who are struggling with breaking unhealthy habits.  But for now, I’m taking an indefinite break from THM (although there are some of the recipes that will become a permanent part of my menu rotation…the desserts in particular are awesome when I am craving a sweet treat.) it wasn’t a good fit for this season of my life. 

I decided that a week and a half ago, and here I am again …7 years into this journey and still searching.  

## Where do I go from here?

For me, my next step is to suck it up and go back to the doctor to get a full hormone panel done and get this thyroid situation sorted out.  I’ve put it off for almost 4 months, because I had really negative experiences with practitioners that have made me fearful and upset about the concept of going to see a doctor.  I always drag my feet and put it off.  But, my new doctor was pretty great and always recommends natural/holistic remedies before resorting to western medicine so I’m going to be an adult and go.  

Beyond that, I am going to continue to weave more movement into my life, and continue pursuing becoming certified in Restorative Exercise. 

## …And as far as the food goes?  

I’m going to go back to my love of culinary arts.  I’m going to keep plugging away, keeping my head above water as a wife and Mom.  I’m going to keep learning to give myself grace and be in tune with what my body needs.  

My culinary pursuits lean towards whole foods, and historically more natural food preparation (fermenting, sprouting, soaking, roasting), so don’t mistake this as my declaration to the world that I’m saying “forget it, I’m going to Taco Bell!”  

This is my crying “uncle” to the obsession, the food legalism, the bondage.  It’s my giving myself permission to have wild rice with my salmon, enjoy some honey on my sourdough bread, and have a rye cocktail with my husband over dinner.   

It’s giving myself permission to enjoy my life mindfully, and focus on self-care.  

A blogger I follow wrote a post recently about how she refused to call the daily task of nourishing her body a “diet”, and instead coined the term “my personal eating style” which I LOVE. 

This is my personal eating style, and I’ll be sharing some favorite family recipes with you soon…and sometimes I’ll provide modifications to make the recipes gluten free, grain free, dairy free, low carb, or vegan…but other times, I may just put it out there, unashamedly, as a recipe I enjoy.  

This relationship I have with food is complicated, pretentious, and maybe unhealthy…I’m not sure yet.  I wanted to finish this post with something profound, like “I’m no longer a searcher—I’m a finder!”  Unfortunately growth and life doesn’t usually resolve itself wrapped in a succinct and dramatic closing sentence. You’re welcome to join me on the ride while I keep searching anyway.
