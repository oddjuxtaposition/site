# The INFJ

![wild tornado](/posts/the-infj/the-infj-header.jpg)

It's funny, I've been thinking *I miss blogging* for months, but now that I have this beautiful shiny new blog I'm paralyzed by the sheer amount of conversations and topics I've accrued.  There's so much I want to say and share. I'm excited to talk about mindfulness, flow, good cocktails, wholesome food, bad art, genuine conversation, movement nutrients, parenting, spirituality, organization, and most likely whatever else pops into my head. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure as hell not here to be an authority on anything.  Maybe if I share my techniques on how to steam canned coconut milk, or how we build an indoor obstacle course basically *every day* for my wild tornado daughter it will make one person’s day a little better.  (Or it will entertain my Grandma.)

Or maybe if I share that several days this week I woke up and wished I could have a break from being a parent for the day it will make one person feel less alone. I would like that. I'm here to be genuine.  I'm here to share this sort of unconventional life-journey I'm on that makes my crunchy friends think I'm endearingly pretentious, my mainstream friends think I’m a dirty hippie, and my family say "she's an acquired taste."  I want to share it in a genuine, honest way.   

So hi, internet friend.  I had a really shit week.  I woke up every morning at 4:30-5AM to my child yelling “Mammmmaaamaaaaa.”  I had high hopes that once I actually got out of bed I would **want** to spend my entire day cleaning up after my destruction machine.  

But I didn't.  

> **Note**: I wrote about a paragraph of justification here about why I didn't want to hang out with my kid every minute of this week.  And then I deleted it.  Because I'm not going to defend being a burnt out parent. Pretty sure it's a common parental condition.  Treatment includes: sleep, steak, good whiskey, and…well, you get the idea. I've heard that there's a permanent cure for parental burnout but it's time-released at about 17 years and counting. 

Fortunately, this week ended on a high note thanks to an awesome babysitter, and a lovely date night giving me a refreshed perspective on life.   

On Tuesday night, however, I wasn’t sure I was going to make it out alive!  So in honor of my lame week, I invented myself a cocktail and now I’m here it to share it with you.  

I wanted something salty but we were out of tequila so a margarita was out.  My on-hand ingredients mostly combined to make very dry martini’s so some inventiveness was in order. 

During the creation process I stumbled upon an interesting piece of cocktail trivia: just before the prohibition era the well-to-do were drinking a cocktail called “The Gin Daisy” —  the recipes vary from the research I’ve done but the consistent theme is: gin, fruit liqueur, lemon juice, sometimes garnished with seltzer water.  Around this time there was also a huge push in the tourism industry to encourage people to vacation in Mexico, where the local bartenders were often asked for a “Gin Daisy.”  Because gin and lemons weren’t easy or cost-effective to source the bartenders started substituting out tequila for gin, limes for lemons, and thus the classic margarita was born!  Not sure where the salt came from, but it was a good call if you ask me. 

This bit of research gave me enough confidence that the flavor profile of what I had in mind would be well-balanced, and fulfill the requirements of my crappy Tuesday evening.  It’s basically “me” in a glass, gin-based, mildly sweet, a bit salty, and a hint of citrus, but rather than naming it “The Badass Lindsey” I decided to be a little bit more subtle. 

Cheers!

**THE INFJ** 

- **2 oz Gin** (*Something smooth, mellow, not too floral, I used Watershed Gin from Catoctin Creek Distilling, in Virginia. Hendricks would work fine. Revolution Spirits Austin Reserve Gin from here in Austin is also pretty exceptional.*)
- **1 oz Cointreau**
- **.5 oz Creme De violette liqueur**
- **Juice from 1/2 lime**
- **4 slices of fresh Jalapeno** (*More or less to taste. I wouldn't entirely leave it out.*)
- **Salt for the rim** (I used [Hawaiian Lava Salt] here)

Run a lime wedge around the rim of your glass, and dip it in delicious salty goodness.  

Place 2 slices of jalapeño in the bottom of the glass, and then fill glass with ice taking care not to knock off all the salt. 

Combine the rest of the ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake it all up. 

Pour delicious liquor over ice, top with remaining jalapeño slices, enjoy!
